new year, new opportunities.
bi is no exception.
i severely neglected this project during the fall semester but it's just spilt milk.
time to make up for it this semester.

i wish to propose bi as yet another senior project to the upcoming class at vu.
except i definitely need to focus on a specific topic.
after reading my diary entries from june (which btw, quite a while ago, and what a clown i am...)
  it seems like i want to focus on this distinction between screens and windows.
additionally, i wanted to bring more attention to the lifecycle.
i feel like there's a lot of potential there but it's also going to require significant research
  to find a good direction for that aspect of bi.

but to also talk about some bi work that i've done over the past few months...
i came across the google material design icons and they are a really great set of images
  that one could use for an app of any platform: web, ios, android, etc...
i wrote a small bash script that would pull all these icons and put them in the /var directory
  of a linux fs.
seemed like nice little module that would come in handy and hopefully find its place in bi...

what else...
i mean, i'm trying to propose this as a senior design topic so my priority right now
  is to find a good line of work that the juniors could do some research on this semester
  and work on during the next.
perhaps that screens vs windows thing could be a starting point...
  resolutions must also be considered...
  dpi's as well...
  physical size...
  screen-types: desktop, tablet, phone, wearable..

that's enough for now...
