chapters:
1. Introduction
- Welcome to breadinterface. 
- breadinterface defines a new way to write programs 
  1. set up the view (or UI) and models
  2. define actions for each controller to perform on the model 
  3. update the UI

2. Getting Started
	1. Create Xcode Project
	- type: empty (NOT single view)

	2. Set breadinterface Project Configurations
	- Note: BI targets all the way down to iOS 5.0
	- frameworks to include: CoreData, Twitter, MessageUI
	- drag (and copy) over the breadinterface folder into the project
	- in your "<project-name>-Prefix.pch" file, add the following line within the #if block:
		#import "breadinterface.h"
	- do a build

	3. Build your first subclass of BIViewController
	- create a new Objective-C class called "XXMainMenuController" where XX = your two character namespace
	- subclass: BIViewController
	- in the @implementation block, add the following code:

		(void)setupUI 
		{ 
			self.tl = self.menuButton; 
			self.tr = self.searchButton; 
			self.bl = self.shareButton; 
			self.br = self.addButton; 
			[super setupUI];
		}

	4. Setup the AppDelegate
	- place the following code in your application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method definition:
	{
	    self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]];
	    // Override point for customization after application launch.
	    self.window.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
	    
	    XXViewController *vc = [[XXViewController alloc] init];
	    vc.title = @"the XX app";

	    UINavigationController *nav = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController: vc];
	    [self.window setRootViewController: nav];
	    
	    [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
	    return YES;
	}


	5. Run the project
	- choose your target and run!

3. "An Indepth Look"
	1. "What is breadinterface"
	- An interface is the mechanism that a user uses to interact with a program. 
		- The most common one we know of is the Graphic User Interface (GUI)
			- using graphical elements to represent data in a model
	- breadinterface is another type of user interface that enforces a 2 toolbar, 4 button rule. There will always be a top bar and a bottom bar, and one button on each ends of each bar, totaling in four buttons. Each button is given an action that the program will perform on the data. The data is represented in some way on the
